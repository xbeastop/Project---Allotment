| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Mathematics          | Accountancy          | History                |

### Final Report
The final report provides a PDF summary of allotment results, determined by a comprehensive evaluation process that considers various factors. The allotment is primarily based on the applicant's Plus Two marks, utilizing a scoring system for the applied course. Furthermore, the allotment process incorporates the following elements:
- **Course Weightage:** The administrator has the flexibility to control the eligibility of certain courses for specific student backgrounds. For instance, a science student may apply to any course, but the allotment can be influenced by the course weightage. This allows prioritization of students from the humanities stream for certain courses.
- **Indexing Subjects:** In cases like science subjects, such as BCA, the allotment process goes beyond the overall score. It considers specific indexing subjects, like mathematics or computer science, adding an extra layer of precision to the evaluation. This ensures a nuanced and fair allotment process that takes into account the unique requirements of different courses and subject areas.
